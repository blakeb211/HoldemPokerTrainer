Unzip and copy the pre-built databases into a folder named "Databases" in the same directory as the program file.

This location is created by the program the first time you Simulate games, 
so you could also let it create the folder and build an empty database 
(which takes about 1.5 minutes) and then copy and paste the pre-build database over it.
