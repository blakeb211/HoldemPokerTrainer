UPDATE Get_Post_Flop_Percentage() Method to take the suit of the cards into account
	Dramatically Speed up the Hand Evaluator, Simulate 4 billion hands, and 
	let the Get_Post_Flop_Percentage() method search for records with the exact flop shown.

ADD HAND() CONSTRUCTOR THAT TAKES A STRING LIKE ("A-c J-h 10-c 9-d A-s")

GO THROUGH PROJECT AND REFACTOR

ADD MORE UNIT TESTS AND ADD UNIT_TESTS.CS FILE TO GITHUB

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AT CURRENT CODE STATE, simulating and saving 4 billion hands will fill 252 GB and take 58 days!!
That is way too long for this to be a reasonable way to do it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POSSIBLE FIXES TO THIS PROBLEM:
		Write tables in 2GB Chunks to Memory and then save all at once to disk.
		Do that 125 times.

		Save each hole card combo to its own table for faster lookups

		Compress data by encoding it as integers (1 - 52 for each card and 1 or 0 for true or false)

		Speed up hand evaluator - 2598960 unique 5 cards

		Speed up sorting algorithm


CHANGED WINFLAG TO INTEGER
44016 records = C * 2316 kilobytes
104016 records = C * 5544 kilobytes
Solve for C, 
		  C = 18.76
4,000,000,000 / 18.76 / 1024 / 1024 = 200 Gigabytes for 4 billion records

60,000 record took 1.21 minutes

60,000 = C2 * 1.21 minutes
    C2 = 49,586 records per minute

4,000,000,000 / 49,586 = 80,667 minutes == 56 days
