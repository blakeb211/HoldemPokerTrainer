UPDATE Get_Post_Flop_Percentage() Method to take the suit of the cards into account
	Dramatically Speed up the Hand Evaluator, Simulate 4 billion hands, and 
	let the Get_Post_Flop_Percentage() method search for records with the exact flop shown.

ADD HAND() CONSTRUCTOR THAT TAKES A STRING LIKE ("A-c J-h 10-c 9-d A-s")

GO THROUGH PROJECT AND REFACTOR

ADD MORE UNIT TESTS AND ADD UNIT_TESTS.CS FILE TO GITHUB

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AT CURRENT CODE STATE, simulating and saving 4 billion hands will fill 252 GB and take 58 days!!
That is way too long for this to be a reasonable way to do it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write tables in 2GB Chunks to Memory and then save all at once to disk.
Do that 125 times.
